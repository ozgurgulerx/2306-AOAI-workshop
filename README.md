# 2306-AOAI-workshop


## Welcome to AzureOpenAI workshop
The goal of the workshop is to enable builders so that they can start developing innovative use-cases on AzureOpenAI. \
Although main focus will be on AOAI capabilities and increasing developer speed with frameworks like Langchain & Semantic Kernel \
we will opportunistically use the wider capabilities of the Azure platform, where and when required and is feasible to show without digressing from the main objective.
